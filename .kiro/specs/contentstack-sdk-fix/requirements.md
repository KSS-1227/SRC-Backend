# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Contentstack integration is experiencing a critical SDK issue where the `.find()` method is failing with a "Cannot call a class as a function" error. This prevents content fetching from working properly, breaking the semantic search functionality. The integration needs to be updated to use the correct Contentstack SDK version and API patterns to ensure reliable content synchronization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Contentstack SDK to work correctly, so that content can be fetched from Contentstack without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the Contentstack SDK SHALL initialize without errors
2. WHEN fetching content types THEN the system SHALL return a valid array of content types
3. WHEN calling `.find()` on content queries THEN the system SHALL return content entries without throwing class instantiation errors
4. WHEN the SDK encounters API errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the content synchronization to work reliably, so that the search functionality has up-to-date content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the sync job THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch all content entries from Contentstack
2. WHEN processing multiple content types THEN the system SHALL handle each content type without SDK errors
3. WHEN fetching entries with pagination THEN the system SHALL retrieve all pages of content correctly
4. IF an API call fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff before failing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SDK integration to be maintainable, so that future updates don't break the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating the SDK THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable version with proper API patterns
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL follow the official SDK documentation patterns
3. WHEN handling different content types THEN the system SHALL use a consistent API approach
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search functionality to work without interruption, so that I can find content reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN the Contentstack connection SHALL be validated successfully
2. WHEN content is requested THEN the system SHALL return results without SDK-related errors
3. WHEN new content is published THEN the system SHALL sync it without API failures
4. IF the SDK fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms or clear error reporting
